title: App automated testing tools Algorithm Development, ByteDance (2021.10-2022.2)
---

From Oct 2021 to Feb 2022, I joined in Quality Lab, ByteDance, supervised by Zhao Zhang. During that time, my job was to 
develop and optimize algorithms for automated testing tools.


### Representative Work
- Contribute to automated testing tools [Fastbot](https://github.com/bytedance/Fastbot_Android).
- Design Algorithms and improve the quality and efficiency of automated testing using Golang.
- Conduct data analysis on the efficiency of automated testing using Python.
- Optimize the effect of automated testing tools, including test coverage, problem interception rate, etc.
