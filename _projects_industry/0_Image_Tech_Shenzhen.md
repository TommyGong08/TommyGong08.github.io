title: Automatic Optical Inspection Algorithm Design (2023.3-2023.12)
---

From March 2023 to Dec 2023, I worked as an AOI Algorithm Engineer in one of the top AOI companies in China. <br>
Due to the commercial confidentiality, detailed work content can not be described.
The following are representative works.

### Representative Works
1. Algorithm design and optimization for Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI), including defects such as open and short circuits, irregular copper, and line debris.
2. Lead and develop parallel computing solutions to reduce computational burden.
3. Compile professional documents regarding top papers and books collaboratively within diverse team and multi-department environments.
